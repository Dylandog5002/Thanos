  <blockquote>A Titan Among Men</blockquote>
	<img src="images/titanAmongMen.jpg" alt="titan">
	<p>Physically, Thanos stands head and shoulders above the average human or humanoid, with powerful muscles, a broad face, and a purple-hued skintone. He often wears a protective suit of armor and his strength is such that he has been physically able to battle—and defeat—the likes of the Hulk.</p>	
  <p>
Not known to use much in the way of personal weapons, the one extremely notable artifact he keeps with him is the Infinity Gauntlet. Made from Uru metal on Nidavellir by Eitri, under duress from Thanos, the Infinity Gauntlet enables its wearer to harness the power of each Infinity Stone added to it. Once it holds all six stones, it becomes the most powerful item in the universe.
